# Samooham

A web-based early warning system to detect and visualize potential overcrowding zones in public spaces and events.

🔍 Overview:
      Samooham aims to reduce stampede-related accidents by predicting high-density zones using real-time crowd simulation data and clustering algorithms.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
       - Frontend: React.js, Leaflet.js
       - Backend: Firebase
       - ML Model: K-Means Clustering (Python)
       - Tools: Git, GitHub

🚧 Planned Features:
       - Live crowd map with heat overlays
       - Zone prediction via K-Means clustering
       - Real-time alerts for risky density areas

📈 Goals:
       - 75% accuracy in identifying potential overcrowding zones using simulation datasets
       - Scalable architecture for real-world deployment

📌 Status:
        In progress – currently setting up frontend layout and ML prototype.
